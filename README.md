Ok heres the idea, you put in some parameters in the beginning and the map is generated, and it spawns random enemies with random names, damage, health. You move around and if you're lucky you don't encounter anything.
If you do encounter something though, you have to try to flee or fight.
Idk about the combat yet something I can do in the console probably like a word flashes and you have to type it idk.
